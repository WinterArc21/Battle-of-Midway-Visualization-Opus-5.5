# WINGS OF FREEDOM

A fan-made Attack on Titan game for the browser: Omni-Directional Mobility gear, Wall Rose, Trost District,
the Forest of Giant Trees, titans that want to eat you, and the Colossal Titan. Everything is generated in code
(geometry, textures, sound and music). No assets are downloaded.

**Play:** open [`dist/wings-of-freedom.html`](dist/wings-of-freedom.html) in Chrome, Edge or Firefox. It is a
single file, so double-clicking it works. For development, serve the repo root
(`npx http-server . -p 8080 -c-1`) and open `http://localhost:8080/aot/`.

## Controls

The keyboard is all you need. The mouse is optional.

| Keys | What they do |
|---|---|
| **← →** | turn. On a rope: swing round the anchor |
| **↑ / ↓** | run / brake. In the air: steer. On a rope: **↑** pumps the swing, **↓** lets the wire out for a longer swing |
| **Z** / **X** (hold) | fire the left / right rope. Each one goes where you face: the anchor nearest the centre of your view, Z in the left half, X in the right, shown by a **Z** / **X** marker before you fire. Let go to release |
| **C** | the marker isn't on the anchor you want? skip both ropes to the next-best anchors |
| **Z + X** | both ropes: zip forward between the two anchors. If either side has a titan in view, both ropes go to the titan |
| **Shift** | gas boost (the reel pulls harder too). Tap it on the ground to jump; clinging to a trunk, it kicks you off |
| **Space** | cut. Hold it while flying fast for Levi's spinning slash. Swooping in on a nape, press it early: the cut fires when you arrive |
| **Esc** / **P** | pause · **M** mute · **H** show or hide the controls card |

WASD mirror the arrows. Blades swap themselves when they go dull (**R** also swaps). Mouse players can click
the game to look around with the mouse; **Q** / **E** and the right mouse button also fire ropes.

**Fighting a titan:** get within about 100 m and hold **Z + X**. Both ropes lock onto its shoulders and the gear
swoops you round behind the neck. Press **Space** as you come in. A cut that's too slow only scratches the nape,
so add **Shift** for speed.

**Modes:**
* **Expedition:** waves of titans from the field, the forest and the breached gate, and the Colossal Titan on wave 3.
* **Training Grounds:** wooden titan dummies through the forest edge, some sliding on pulleys. Cut every nape
  against the clock; your best time is kept.
* **Free Flight:** no titans, infinite gas. Start at the forest edge and fly.

Supply depots (crates under a Survey Corps flag) refill gas, blades and health. There is one on the wall top
either side of the gate, one on the Garrison HQ roof and one on a platform in the forest.

## How the ODM gear works (the physics)

`src/player/odm.js` and `src/player/player.js`, stepped at a fixed 120 Hz with render interpolation:

* **Anchors** are projectiles (300 m/s, 115 m range) that ray-march the collision world. They stick to stone,
  bark, roofs, branches and titan flesh. On a titan, the anchor rides that limb.
* **The wire is a one-sided distance constraint.** It can go slack but never stretch. When it is taut, only the
  outward velocity is removed, so the tangential speed survives. A free swing conserves energy (the bench
  measures under 1 % drift over 12 s).
* **The reel** is a gas-driven winch with a torque curve. It pulls hard from rest and fades as the inward speed
  nears its limit (36 m/s, or 64 m/s with the gas trigger held), and it instantly winds in any slack. A wire
  that shortens while you circle spins you up (angular momentum), which gives the anime's slingshot around a
  trunk.
* **Gas** thrusts where you look, boosts the reel, powers the dash, and is finite. Air drag is quadratic
  (free-fall terminal speed about 75 m/s), and gravity is 14.5 m/s² for snappier, heavier arcs.
* **Rope auto-targeting** (`Player._scan`): candidate anchors come straight from the geometry around you. Each
  nearby trunk contributes the side facing you at a height above you, each branch its nearest stretch, each
  building or wall its nearest face, and each titan its shoulders. Candidates are scored by distance (sweet
  spot about 40 m), height above you, alignment with where you're going, and side, then the best few are
  confirmed by line of sight. The previous pick wins ties, so markers hold still. Small props (cannons, crates)
  are never picked.
* **Letting the wire out** (↓ on a rope) is a brake-reel: under tension the wire runs out at up to 7 m/s, so the
  swing widens instead of the reel winding the slack back in.
* **The nape swoop:** roped to a titan, the gear flies you in three legs: out beside the head, round behind the
  neck, then through the nape at about 33 m/s (44 with Shift). Ropes on anything else go slack meanwhile.
* **Landing assist:** when you are about to hit a surface head-on while flying on a wire, the front vents bleed
  off the closing speed so you land on the trunk instead of hitting it. Sideways passes keep all their speed.
  Held against a wall by a wire, you run up it.
* **Collision** is a swept sphere (sub-steps of 0.3 m or less, up to 12 per tick) against analytic shapes:
  oriented boxes, vertical cylinders, capsules, spheres and a height-field. Nothing tunnels at 100 m/s.
* **Damage:** a slash deals `(40 + relative speed × 12.5) × blade sharpness`. Small titans need about 25 m/s at
  the nape, 15 m titans about 45 m/s, and the Colossal takes several fast cuts.

`node aot/tools/physics-bench.mjs` runs the real player code headless through a free swing, zips, an orbit, a
fall, a run, a wall climb, rope auto-targeting, wire payout and keyboard turning, and checks the numbers.
`node aot/tools/keyboard-bench.mjs 40` lets a keyboard-only bot (↑, alternating X and Z, some Shift) fly the
real forest and reports distance, altitude, how often ropes catch and stalls.
`node aot/tools/combat-bench.mjs 90` lets a keyboard-only bot fight the Expedition and reports kills, nape hits,
grabs and deaths.
`node aot/tools/play-bench.mjs "play=free"` drives the real game in headless Chromium and screenshots a flight.
`node aot/tools/forest-bench.mjs 60` flies AI soldiers through the real forest for a minute and reports altitude,
speed, canopy passes and tunnelling (none). URL flags for testing: `?play=free|expedition`, `?notitans`, `?noallies`,
`?allies=N`, `?noaudio`, `?norender`, `?testworld`, `?sens=1.5`, `?invert`.

Your **comrades**: a few AI Survey Corps soldiers fly on exactly the same ODM physics as you. They hop from tree to
tree and harass titans, which you can watch behind the title screen too.
